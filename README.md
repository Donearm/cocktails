## Bartender Style Recipe Specs

Forked from [David Turnbull](http://dturnbull.org)

### Description

Cocktails is a list of of some popular classic and modern classics cocktail recipes presented (in metric units) in a quick-to-read 'spec sheet' format similar to those used by bartenders.

I realise that different bars/bartenders have their own ways of making drinks that may differ from what I have used, however I’ve tried to give versions of the cocktails that I feel work well internationally  – recipes are a guide, not a book of law! Also, glassware is kept relatively simple (similar to what you would expect in a good home bar without needing to get too exotic).

There are actually 2 different lists: COCKTAILS.md and MAIN\_COCKTAILS.md. The first contains all the cocktails while the latter only the most used or famous (according to my experience, YMMV) ones. All the cocktails in this second list are present in the first one too, I just thought that extracting the main ones in a more compact list would make it easier to look up them.
