## Bartender Style Recipe Specs

The recipes listed in this spec sheet are a mix of some popular classics and modern classics presented (in metric units) in a 'spec sheet' format similar to how bartenders use them. The list comes from a similar list I provided  when I used to train bartenders on cocktails and spirits in London, UK.
 
I realise that different bars/bartenders have their own ways of making drinks that may differ from what I have used, however I’ve tried to give versions of the cocktails that I feel work well internationally  – recipes are a guide, not a book of law! Also, glassware is keep relatively simple (similar to what you would expect in a good home bar without needing to get too exotic).
